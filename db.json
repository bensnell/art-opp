The key objectives are to create a lasting tribute to Rosalie Gardiner Jones that is integrated with the Cold Spring Harbor State Park site and utilizes materials that are durable and require minimal maintenance and care.<br/><br/>Jones was an outspoken advocate for woman\u2019s suffrage, most often on the grass roots level. She not only<br/>travelled across Long Island with her yellow \u201cSuffrage Wagon,\u201d she also campaigned for women\u2019s suffrage<br/>in New York City, Washington, DC, and across the country. Most famously, she led a \u201chike\u201d from the Bronx<br/>to Albany in December 1912 to present a petition to the newly elected governor urging that women be given<br/>the right to vote. Two months later, \u201cGeneral\u201d Jones led her \u201cArmy of the Hudson\u201d on another march or<br/>\u201cpilgrimage\u201d from Newark, New Jersey, to Washington, DC, to participate in the famous suffrage parade on<br/>the eve of Woodrow Wilson\u2019s inauguration. Jones and her followers wore long brown pilgrim capes for this<br/>march and their second hike up the west side of the Hudson to Albany in 1914. These marches gained extensive publicity for the suffrage cause in newspapers throughout the country and resulted in General<br/>Jones becoming a national celebrity. She spoke for suffrage in Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, and<br/>New Jersey. Jones also led parades on Long Island, flew over Staten Island in a bi-plane dropping suffrage<br/>leaflets, and campaigned throughout New York State in a yellow suffrage automobile, spreading the gospel<br/>of Votes for Women. Jones was born in New York City, but spent much of her life in the family mansion on<br/>the west side of Cold Spring Harbor, opposite what is now Cold Spring Harbor State Park.<br/><br/>The monument to memorialize \u201cGeneral\u201d Jones should engage the public. It should communicate the<br/>strength and courage exhibited by Jones as she endeavored to make women\u2019s suffrage a reality through its<br/>materiality, its form and its setting.

Throughout the canon of art history, the human figure has been a central theme, as we grapple with our own existence, feeding a desire to self represent and to understand our place in the universe. This exhibition will present works by contemporary artists who address the figure not just as an object of beauty, or a subject of anatomy, but rather elaborate on contemporary themes of body positive depictions of the human form, including all body types, ages and genders, celebrating diversity as well as the timeless beauty of the body.<br/><br/>What is Body Positivity? The body-positive movement, which dates back to early Victorian reforms against the corset, 1960\u2019s initiatives against fat-shaming, and more recently via social media with influencers challenging unrealistic standards of beauty, is \u201crooted in the belief that all human beings should have a positive body image, while challenging the ways in which society presents and views the physical body. The goal of the movement is to address unrealistic beauty standards and to build the confidence of oneself and others. The movement sets forth the notion that beauty is a construct of society, and poses that this construct should not infringe upon one's ability to feel confidence or self-worth. The movement states that neither fat-shaming nor skinny-shaming is acceptable, and that all body types can and should be celebrated.\u201d<br/><br/>The \u201cBody Beautiful\u201d exhibition is open to artists of all genders. Works will be considered in any medium, including painting, drawing, sculpture, photography, mixed media, video, and performance amongst others. <br/><br/>The group show will take place at The Untitled Space gallery in Tribeca, New York, as well as online on Artsy. The exhibit is open to submissions until September 30, 2019.<br/><br/>ABOUT THE UNTITLED SPACE<br/>The Untitled Space is an art gallery located in Tribeca, New York in a landmark building on Lispenard Street.

FringeArts received a New Audiences New Places grant from the William Penn Foundation in the spring of 2018. This grant, titled Fringe Populi: Building Audiences through Public Performance, seeks to \u201cbuild new audiences through large-scale public practice works [that] generate both wide attention through scale, spectacle, and resonance of content,\u201d and that provide \u201cmore focused, deeper engagement with individuals recruited to participate in the work.\u201d<br/><br/>Previous examples of public practice pieces stewarded by FringeArts include Le Grand Continental (2012, Sylvain \u00c9mard), 100% Philadelphia (2014, Rimini Protokoll), Gala (2016, Jer\u00f4me Bel), Le Super Grand Continental (2018, Sylvain \u00c9mard), and \u00daumbal: Nomadic Choreography for Inhabitants (2019, Mariana Arteaga). The 2020 Fringe Populi piece will be the culminating performance in the Fringe Populi New Audiences New Places grant that aims to break down perception barriers which keep the Philadelphia public from engaging in contemporary performance.<br/><br/>The Artist\u2019s piece should aim to engage between 100-250 performers at varying levels of engagement and commitment. Artist proposals will provide a clear outline of project dramaturgy, recruitment, rehearsal structure, and performance. The priorities of the Fringe Populi project are to cultivate wide encounters of contemporary performance with the Philadelphia public, present work that is free and outdoors, and to engage with civically-activated spaces.<br/><br/>Proposal applications open on Monday, September 9th and are due back to FringeArts by 5:00pm on Monday, October 7th.

Artists are invited to consider and respond to the following considerations and questions:<br/><br/>As symbols of Confederate and Colonial power are currently being destroyed, dismantled, reconfigured, or exiled from public view, what new representations should fill their void? What monuments should be created to reflect today\u2019s values and our desire to project those into the future? Who or what should be given the space, representation, and honor in these new monumental artworks? More specifically, as the reconfiguration of monuments in public space reflects the process of history writing, what histories of New York should be remembered or recovered?<br/><br/>What kind of monument might shape public consciousness in the creation of civic agents empowered with social and political self-determination? What kind of monument might best to serve and preserve the reclamation of New York\u2019s under-recognized or repressed histories? How might monument-makers resist the obdurate, authoritarian chauvinist impulses that commonly accompany traditional representational strategies of monuments?<br/><br/>This open call will be the major component of Socrates Sculpture Park\u2019s year-long engagement with recent discourse on the current state and future of monuments in the United States. It is a thematic adaption of \u2018The Socrates Annual Fellowship\u2019 and exhibition, and incorporates an extended selection process and production timeline as well as inclusion in an exhibition publication.<br/><br/>These monument prototypes for New York City will be presented alongside three new commissions for speculative monuments for America by major artists, and a collective monument for Queens created by participants in the Park\u2019s after-school program for teenagers: Socrateens.<br/><br/>Fellowship recipients will receive a $5,000 production grant to support their project a $1,000 honorarium and four-months of seven-days-a-week access to the resources and fabrication facilities of the Park\u2019s outdoor artist studio.<br/><br/>Artist Fellows are responsible for the fabrication, transportation (if necessary) and installation of their works. Socrates will provide limited technical and installation assistance during a three-week installation period, M-F, 10AM \u2013 6PM. Specifics of installation assistance will be discussed with each artist selected.<br/><br/>SITE & CONTEXT<br/><br/>Before preparing their applications, artists are strongly encouraged to visit Socrates \u2013 a unique New York City public park located on the East River waterfront in an industrial area of Long Island City, Queens \u2013 and to explore Socrates\u2019 website and exhibition archive to learn about the history and context of the organization. Visiting the Park will give applicants a better sense of the factors that effect installations in the Park and help impart insights into the available facilities \u2013 from the tools and equipment in Socrates\u2019 artist studio to the resources of the surrounding neighborhood.<br/><br/>REVIEW PROCESS<br/><br/>\u2018The Socrates Annual Fellowship program\u2019 is based on a competitive, open application process. Completed on-line applications must be submitted by the deadline (Monday, November 25, 2019 by 11:59pm) and will be reviewed by the Socrates exhibition department and outside curatorial advisors. Ten to twelve artists will be selected for the 2020 program. Artists are selected based on the compelling nature of the project proposed, clarity of intent, unique approach to the site, and public context.<br/><br/>Following the recommendations of the curatorial advisors, Socrates staff will contact applicants individually to discuss proposed projects before confirming the final selection in early 2020.<br/><br/>FELLOWSHIP<br/><br/>Once accepted, Socrates staff members will meet with each Artist Fellow to discuss project proposals in detail and begin to assist with the development, engineering, and installation of the work. A group meeting for all Artist Fellows and Socrates staff will take place one evening in late winter of 2020, followed by an on-site orientation and individual progress meetings throughout the Fellowship to assess progress, troubleshoot issues, and review next steps. Selected works are subject to final approval by Socrates staff and must meet safety requirements to be able to withstand the effects of weather and public use.<br/><br/>ELIGIBILITY<br/><br/>Fellowships are awarded to artists whose careers and artistic practices would benefit from the opportunity.

Environmental extinction predominantly first and foremost, but also resumed economic stability, political divisiveness, information overloads, cancel culture mania, all are together thought to be at every manner of places along an axis of toppling the heck over, with varying ideas circulated as to which side of their scales are too overstuffed.<br/><br/>Art and entertainment feel indistinguishable from one another, piled together as \u201ccontent\u201d, which is consistently billed as in overwhelming supply from creators both amateur and professional; News peppers everyday moments through our devices\u2019 push notifications and peer updates; tech-aided romantic possibilities appear infinite, as do all the other seductions of a globalized world\u2014people to meet, people to follow, things to buy and eat and do. (Should one be able to afford it\u2026For better or worse, then, the \u2018too much\u2019-ness of everything is certainly on the mind. In line with these grumblings of overmuch, SPRING/BREAK Art Show 2020 seeks similar inquiries into the paradoxes and nuances of \u2018more\u2019. For both upcoming New York and Los Angeles shows, IN EXCESS is actively searching for exhibitions dealing with virtues and/or limitations of maximalism, materialism, digression, hysterical realism, capitalism, encyclopedii, redundancy, consumerism, the over-foot-noted and the overlabored. Submissions may or may not include touchstones on multimedia, multiracial, or multiverse theories and perspectives; environmentalism, globalization, and future shock; the baroque, the Simulacrum, the epic, human play, the hall of mirrors, or any manner of other meditations on the Anthropocene and its anxieties; and, maybe\u2014where we can find them\u2014joys.<br/><br/>The pleasure of \u2018more is more\u2019 may be explored through the joyously overindulged overabundance of ideas, forms, perspectives. Aesthetically, \u2018the bigger, brighter, busier, the better\u2019 was once the zeitgeist with the intent to create, not a nauseous geegaw of consumer pleasures, but an impression that rattled complacency\u2014generating, instead, awe, surprise, wonder; a sense of the infinitude of our World. Where is our awe now in all this excess? Where is the new Rocaille? Is it any good? Is it a spectre of Greed or Good? How much is not enough, and when is too little too soon?<br/><br/>References in the current and former art landscape include, but are not limited to, Peter Saul\u2019s rambunctious hypercolor paintings of interwoven political brutality, Joyce Kozloff\u2019s reframing of \u201cwomen\u2019s work\u201d in her P & D movement pieces and their extension over into, and reframing by, artist Liz Collins, William Powhida\u2019s art world cartography of complicit capitalism. Marco Brambilla crafts sprawling video pop cultural hells and heavens, packed with re-appropriated movie characters all fighting each other for a place in the pantheon, Mickalene Thomas constructs dizzying pastiche domiciles where tactile textiles, personal experience, and the figure from memory converge, authors like Thomas Pynchon and Zadie Smith jam-pack characters into stories teeming with a dance of detritus both intimate and historical; Stan Brakhage deploys the barrage for the sake of recalibrating our vision, Anselm Kiefer, with his fussy gigantic meditations, employs scale to save our soul. Robert Breer\u2019s lightning speed animations stagger in their short running time pummel, Azikiwe Mohammed toils to find overstocked thrift store tapestries of Black utopias, and for Alison Zuckerman, art history, digital self-documentation, and Photoshop fiddling all find themselves locked, arm-in-arm, in triplicate.<br/><br/>Wilde suggested moderation in art and life was a fatal thing. But how does it support or subvert our consumptive excesses? Like Gittes once said to Mulwray, \u201chow much better can you eat?

Weathering then is the process by which things in our world, and the world itself, are in the process of always becoming.

Submissions should address themes related to the work of the 2020 Nasher Prize Laureate Michael Rakowitz. This year\u2019s symposium will be moderated by Dr. Nada Shabout of University of North Texas, founding president of the Association for Modern and Contemporary Art from the Arab World, Iran and Turkey.<br/> <br/>The Nasher Prize Graduate Symposium, addresses a broad audience of art historians and museum professionals, allowing symposium participants to receive feedback from fellow presenters, the moderator, the keynote speaker, and audience members. Students selected to present papers will also have their work published in the annual symposium compendium, together with the paper delivered by the keynote speaker, yet to be announced.<br/> <br/>Since his career began in the late 1990s, Michael Rakowitz\u2019s dynamic body of work has involved intensive research, resulting in an array of objects, environments, films, and publications that seek to reclaim, reposition, or refocus complicated aspects of material and cultural histories or events. He has especial interest in refugee and migrant populations, particularly from the Middle East. Often durational in nature, his projects frequently enlist the participation of collaborators or the public to create objects or events, making the work as much participatory as it is material.<br/> <br/>Since 2003, Rakowitz\u2019s work has considered his own heritage as an American descendent of the Iraqi Jewish diaspora with projects that include, among other efforts, research into the archeological artifacts and sites that have been destroyed or compromised due to political conflict. His ongoing project The invisible enemy should not exist, begun in 2007, seeks to recreate the thousands of artifacts that were looted or destroyed in the raiding of the National Museum of Iraq, Baghdad in 2003, as well as artifacts decimated by ISIS in 2015 during a destructive spree on cultural sites and institutions throughout Iraq. For this, Rakowitz solicits the help of communities of people to remake each of the artifacts, at their original scale, using images and information from the University of Chicago\u2019s Oriental Institute database. Employing packaging from Middle Eastern food products and Arabic newspapers in combination with simple sculptural means, such as papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9, the ancient objects are recreated as colorful, text- and image-laden sculptures that the artist has described as \u201cghosts\u201d.<br/> <br/>Suggested Topics for the 2020 Nasher Prize Graduate Symposium:<br/>\u2013Provisional architecture within sculpture<br/>\u2013Archaeology and the politics of cultural heritage<br/>\u2013Food in social practice and community-healing<br/>\u2013Traditional sculptural methods in contemporary sculptural practice<br/>\u2013Transmissions of skill or expertise as forms of resistance to cultural erasure<br/>- Social media and e-commerce sites as paths of research<br/>- Artistic responses to the destruction of cultural patrimony<br/> <br/>Complete proposals must include the following:<br/>\u2013Contact information, participant\u2019s field and university affiliation, and CV<br/>\u2013Paper title and abstract of no more than 200 words, and 3 to 5 keywords<br/><br/>Proposals are due by Sunday, December 15, 2019.<br/>Send submissions and questions to symposium@nashersculpturecenter.org<br/> <br/>We hope to notify successful applicants by January 13, 2020.

Artists have continued to be interested in animals as subject matter. Peaceable Kingdom by Edward Hicks takes its theme from a passage in the bible which tells of the animals gathering together in harmony, Guernica by Picasso tells a story of war, Deborah Butterfield\u2019s horses are a metaphorical substitute for herself, Louise Bourgeois\u2019 spiders allude to the strength of her mother, and were used as a symbol of nurturing and protection. Animals are of great importance as companions to humans, bringing joy and comfort into our lives. We cherish animals as part of our families, and also consider them our friends and protectors. Animals, insects and even micro-organisms have important roles in the ecosystem, co-existing and balancing each other out. Some animals and insects help to reduce negative impacts on the globe, addressing issues such as global warming and pollution. Animals deserve our respect. Issues around extinction and the care and treatment of animals are of the utmost importance. How are artists incorporating animals into their artwork today?

Environmental extinction predominantly first and foremost, but also resumed economic stability, political divisiveness, information overloads, cancel culture mania, all are together thought to be at every manner of places along an axis of toppling the heck over, with varying ideas circulated as to which side of their scales are too overstuffed.<br/><br/>Art and entertainment feel indistinguishable from one another, piled together as \u201ccontent\u201d, which is consistently billed as in overwhelming supply from creators both amateur and professional; News peppers everyday moments through our devices\u2019 push notifications and peer updates; tech-aided romantic possibilities appear infinite, as do all the other seductions of a globalized world\u2014people to meet, people to follow, things to buy and eat and do. (Should one be able to afford it\u2026For better or worse, then, the \u2018too much\u2019-ness of everything is certainly on the mind. In line with these grumblings of overmuch, SPRING/BREAK Art Show 2020 seeks similar inquiries into the paradoxes and nuances of \u2018more\u2019. For both upcoming New York and Los Angeles shows, IN EXCESS is actively searching for exhibitions dealing with virtues and/or limitations of maximalism, materialism, digression, hysterical realism, capitalism, encyclopedii, redundancy, consumerism, the over-foot-noted and the overlabored. Submissions may or may not include touchstones on multimedia, multiracial, or multiverse theories and perspectives; environmentalism, globalization, and future shock; the baroque, the Simulacrum, the epic, human play, the hall of mirrors, or any manner of other meditations on the Anthropocene and its anxieties; and, maybe\u2014where we can find them\u2014joys.<br/><br/>The pleasure of \u2018more is more\u2019 may be explored through the joyously overindulged overabundance of ideas, forms, perspectives. Aesthetically, \u2018the bigger, brighter, busier, the better\u2019 was once the zeitgeist with the intent to create, not a nauseous geegaw of consumer pleasures, but an impression that rattled complacency\u2014generating, instead, awe, surprise, wonder; a sense of the infinitude of our World. Where is our awe now in all this excess? Where is the new Rocaille? Is it any good? Is it a spectre of Greed or Good? How much is not enough, and when is too little too soon?<br/><br/>References in the current and former art landscape include, but are not limited to, Peter Saul\u2019s rambunctious hypercolor paintings of interwoven political brutality, Joyce Kozloff\u2019s reframing of \u201cwomen\u2019s work\u201d in her P & D movement pieces and their extension over into, and reframing by, artist Liz Collins, William Powhida\u2019s art world cartography of complicit capitalism. Marco Brambilla crafts sprawling video pop cultural hells and heavens, packed with re-appropriated movie characters all fighting each other for a place in the pantheon, Mickalene Thomas constructs dizzying pastiche domiciles where tactile textiles, personal experience, and the figure from memory converge, authors like Thomas Pynchon and Zadie Smith jam-pack characters into stories teeming with a dance of detritus both intimate and historical; Stan Brakhage deploys the barrage for the sake of recalibrating our vision, Anselm Kiefer, with his fussy gigantic meditations, employs scale to save our soul. Robert Breer\u2019s lightning speed animations stagger in their short running time pummel, Azikiwe Mohammed toils to find overstocked thrift store tapestries of Black utopias, and for Alison Zuckerman, art history, digital self-documentation, and Photoshop fiddling all find themselves locked, arm-in-arm, in triplicate.<br/><br/>Wilde suggested moderation in art and life was a fatal thing. But how does it support or subvert our consumptive excesses? Like Gittes once said to Mulwray, \u201chow much better can you eat?

Artists are invited to consider and respond to the following considerations and questions:<br/><br/>As symbols of Confederate and Colonial power are currently being destroyed, dismantled, reconfigured, or exiled from public view, what new representations should fill their void? What monuments should be created to reflect today\u2019s values and our desire to project those into the future? Who or what should be given the space, representation, and honor in these new monumental artworks? More specifically, as the reconfiguration of monuments in public space reflects the process of history writing, what histories of New York should be remembered or recovered?<br/><br/>What kind of monument might shape public consciousness in the creation of civic agents empowered with social and political self-determination? What kind of monument might best to serve and preserve the reclamation of New York\u2019s underrecognized or repressed histories? How might monument-makers resist the obdurate, authoritarian chauvinist impulses that commonly accompany traditional representational strategies of monuments?<br/><br/>This open call will be the major component of Socrates Sculpture Park\u2019s year-long engagement with recent discourse on the current state and future of monuments in the United States. It is a thematic adaption of \u2018The Socrates Annual Fellowship\u2019 and exhibition, and incorporates an extended selection process and production timeline as well as inclusion in an exhibition publication.<br/><br/>These monument prototypes for New York City will be presented alongside three new commissions for speculative monuments for America by major artists, and a collective monument for Queens created by participants in the Park\u2019s after-school program for teenagers: Socrateens.<br/><br/>Fellowship recipients will receive a $5,000 production grant to support their project a $1,000 honorarium and four-months of seven-days-a-week access to the resources and fabrication facilities of the Park\u2019s outdoor artist studio.<br/><br/>Artist Fellows are responsible for the fabrication, transportation (if necessary) and installation of their works.

Completed on-line applications must be submitted by the deadline (Monday, November 25, 2019 by 11:59pm) and will be reviewed by the Socrates exhibition department and outside curatorial advisors. Ten to twelve artists will be selected for the 2020 program. Artists are selected based on the compelling nature of the project proposed, clarity of intent, unique approach to the site, and public context.<br/><br/>Following the recommendations of the curatorial advisors, Socrates staff will contact applicants individually to discuss proposed projects before confirming the final selection in early 2020.<br/><br/><br/>FELLOWSHIP<br/><br/>Once accepted, Socrates staff members will meet with each Artist Fellow to discuss project proposals in detail and begin to assist with the development, engineering, and installation of the work. A group meeting for all Artist Fellows and Socrates staff will take place one evening in late winter of 2020, followed by an on-site orientation and individual progress meetings throughout the Fellowship to assess progress, troubleshoot issues, and review next steps. Selected works are subject to final approval by Socrates staff and must meet safety requirements to be able to withstand the effects of weather and public use.<br/><br/><br/>ELIGIBILITY<br/><br/>Fellowships are awarded to artists whose careers and artistic practices would benefit from the opportunity.

Environmental extinction predominantly first and foremost, but also resumed economic stability, political divisiveness, information overloads, cancel culture mania, all are together thought to be at every manner of places along an axis of toppling the heck over, with varying ideas circulated as to which side of their scales are too overstuffed.<br/><br/>Art and entertainment feel indistinguishable from one another, piled together as \u201ccontent\u201d, which is consistently billed as in overwhelming supply from creators both amateur and professional; News peppers everyday moments through our devices\u2019 push notifications and peer updates; tech-aided romantic possibilities appear infinite, as do all the other seductions of a globalized world\u2014people to meet, people to follow, things to buy and eat and do. (Should one be able to afford it\u2026For better or worse, then, the \u2018too much\u2019-ness of everything is certainly on the mind. In line with these grumblings of overmuch, SPRING/BREAK Art Show 2020 seeks similar inquiries into the paradoxes and nuances of \u2018more\u2019. For both upcoming New York and Los Angeles shows, IN EXCESS is actively searching for exhibitions dealing with virtues and/or limitations of maximalism, materialism, digression, hysterical realism, capitalism, encyclopedii, redundancy, consumerism, the over-foot-noted and the overlabored. Submissions may or may not include touchstones on multimedia, multiracial, or multiverse theories and perspectives; environmentalism, globalization, and future shock; the baroque, the Simulacrum, the epic, human play, the hall of mirrors, or any manner of other meditations on the Anthropocene and its anxieties; and, maybe\u2014where we can find them\u2014joys.<br/><br/>The pleasure of \u2018more is more\u2019 may be explored through the joyously overindulged overabundance of ideas, forms, perspectives. Aesthetically, \u2018the bigger, brighter, busier, the better\u2019 was once the zeitgeist with the intent to create, not a nauseous geegaw of consumer pleasures, but an impression that rattled complacency\u2014generating, instead, awe, surprise, wonder; a sense of the infinitude of our World. Where is our awe now in all this excess? Where is the new Rocaille? Is it any good? Is it a spectre of Greed or Good? How much is not enough, and when is too little too soon?<br/><br/>References in the current and former art landscape include, but are not limited to, Peter Saul\u2019s rambunctious hypercolor paintings of interwoven political brutality, Joyce Kozloff\u2019s reframing of \u201cwomen\u2019s work\u201d in her P & D movement pieces and their extension over into, and reframing by, artist Liz Collins, William Powhida\u2019s art world cartography of complicit capitalism. Marco Brambilla crafts sprawling video pop cultural hells and heavens, packed with re-appropriated movie characters all fighting each other for a place in the pantheon, Mickalene Thomas constructs dizzying pastiche domiciles where tactile textiles, personal experience, and the figure from memory converge, authors like Thomas Pynchon and Zadie Smith jam-pack characters into stories teeming with a dance of detritus both intimate and historical; Stan Brakhage deploys the barrage for the sake of recalibrating our vision, Anselm Kiefer, with his fussy gigantic meditations, employs scale to save our soul. Robert Breer\u2019s lightning speed animations stagger in their short running time pummel, Azikiwe Mohammed toils to find overstocked thrift store tapestries of Black utopias, and for Alison Zuckerman, art history, digital self-documentation, and Photoshop fiddling all find themselves locked, arm-in-arm, in triplicate.<br/><br/>Wilde suggested moderation in art and life was a fatal thing.

Environmental extinction predominantly first and foremost, but also resumed economic stability, political divisiveness, information overloads, cancel culture mania, all are together thought to be at every manner of places along an axis of toppling the heck over, with varying ideas circulated as to which side of their scales are too overstuffed.<br/><br/>Art and entertainment feel indistinguishable from one another, piled together as \u201ccontent\u201d, which is consistently billed as in overwhelming supply from creators both amateur and professional; News peppers everyday moments through our devices\u2019 push notifications and peer updates; tech-aided romantic possibilities appear infinite, as do all the other seductions of a globalized world\u2014people to meet, people to follow, things to buy and eat and do. (Should one be able to afford it\u2026For better or worse, then, the \u2018too much\u2019-ness of everything is certainly on the mind. In line with these grumblings of overmuch, SPRING/BREAK Art Show 2020 seeks similar inquiries into the paradoxes and nuances of \u2018more\u2019. For both upcoming New York and Los Angeles shows, IN EXCESS is actively searching for exhibitions dealing with virtues and/or limitations of maximalism, materialism, digression, hysterical realism, capitalism, encyclopedii, redundancy, consumerism, the over-foot-noted and the overlabored. Submissions may or may not include touchstones on multimedia, multiracial, or multiverse theories and perspectives; environmentalism, globalization, and future shock; the baroque, the Simulacrum, the epic, human play, the hall of mirrors, or any manner of other meditations on the Anthropocene and its anxieties; and, maybe\u2014where we can find them\u2014joys.<br/><br/>The pleasure of \u2018more is more\u2019 may be explored through the joyously overindulged overabundance of ideas, forms, perspectives. Aesthetically, \u2018the bigger, brighter, busier, the better\u2019 was once the zeitgeist with the intent to create, not a nauseous geegaw of consumer pleasures, but an impression that rattled complacency\u2014generating, instead, awe, surprise, wonder; a sense of the infinitude of our World. Where is our awe now in all this excess? Where is the new Rocaille? Is it any good? Is it a spectre of Greed or Good? How much is not enough, and when is too little too soon?<br/><br/>References in the current and former art landscape include, but are not limited to, Peter Saul\u2019s rambunctious hypercolor paintings of interwoven political brutality, Joyce Kozloff\u2019s reframing of \u201cwomen\u2019s work\u201d in her P & D movement pieces and their extension over into, and reframing by, artist Liz Collins, William Powhida\u2019s art world cartography of complicit capitalism. Marco Brambilla crafts sprawling video pop cultural hells and heavens, packed with re-appropriated movie characters all fighting each other for a place in the pantheon, Mickalene Thomas constructs dizzying pastiche domiciles where tactile textiles, personal experience, and the figure from memory converge, authors like Thomas Pynchon and Zadie Smith jam-pack characters into stories teeming with a dance of detritus both intimate and historical; Stan Brakhage deploys the barrage for the sake of recalibrating our vision, Anselm Kiefer, with his fussy gigantic meditations, employs scale to save our soul. Robert Breer\u2019s lightning speed animations stagger in their short running time pummel, Azikiwe Mohammed toils to find overstocked thrift store tapestries of Black utopias, and for Alison Zuckerman, art history, digital self-documentation, and Photoshop fiddling all find themselves locked, arm-in-arm, in triplicate.<br/><br/>Wilde suggested moderation in art and life was a fatal thing. But how does it support or subvert our consumptive excesses? Like Gittes once said to Mulwray, \u201chow much better can you eat?

The School\u2019s activities are meant for all those interested and passionate in art, graduated students or professionals who want to deepen their knowledge and improve their practical skills.

With an interdisciplinary approach, the course provides practical training and experience within museums and exhibition settings. Its international faculty includes curators and museum professionals, artists and critics. The course is designed to increase students understanding of the intellectual and technical tasks of the curator figure. English-taught lectures cover both theoretical and practical topics that go from the history of contemporary visual arts and practices of exhibition-making, to Exhibition Management. The students will participate in weekly activities, such as artist studio visits, tours of exhibition spaces, networking events and workshops. The program culminates with the set up of the exhibition.<br/>The Summer School includes visits of specific art venues all over the city of Venice during the 17th International Architecture Venice Biennale. A series of selected case studies will offer the students an opportunity to observe the development of contemporary art. The School\u2019s goal is to align these specific theoretical lectures with a practical approach. Besides the theoretical lectures, a series of laboratories and workshops aims to introduce the students to the work of critical text writing, press releases and to structure all the different aspects of publishing. The students will be offered the possibility of a gallery training and of setting up together - with one of our tutors, their exhibition in Venice, as a final project of the course.<br/>The first module:<br/>June 3rd \u2013 August 5th, 2020<br/>The first module involves 350 contact hours:<br/><br/>1.

For the open call, we would like to view completed works that address this topic and/or proposals for work related to the topic. <br/> <br/>Home/Land will look at the influence of the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850 on Lewis Latimer\u2019s family, focusing on the tactics used to detain, deport, and re-enslave \u201crunaways\u201d with current practices used by Immigration Customs Enforcement to control the influx of immigrants, refugees, and asylum seekers.

The Industrial Revolution begin the mass manufacture of textiles, making them available to ever larger swaths of society.

This program will feature a total of 4 exhibitions, from May 2020- January 2021. <br/><br/>The space that is open for showcasing in the duration listed is the western-facing windows-- the triangular window space on the corner of Rockwell and Fulton and the large windows that are parallel to Rockwell Place. The exhibition proposal must prioritize the viewpoint from the street looking into the windows.<br/><br/>Ideal proposals will include consideration of the unique opportunity for visibility 24/7 in this public- facing space. UrbanGlass is seeking proposals that clearly showcases plans for how the artist plans to use the windows explicitly. Please be sure to explicitly describe your use of the space and how your work will be viewed from Fulton and Rockwell Street. Your plans should be bold and visible from the street view and consider the nature of this space. The majority of viewers seeing your exhibition will interface with the installation from the street-view, and not by walking into the gallery.  <br/><br/>Applications can include proposals for:<br/><br/>Installations. <br/>An installation of artwork that is representative of work being made in the contemporary glass community. The proposed works can be a combination of glass and mixed media.<br/><br/>Performances.<br/>Performances using handmade glass, scheduled for the opening nights of exhibitions of AVAC and possibly additional times that include high foot-traffic hours for the Rockwell and Fulton corner. If this format is proposed, this must include a plan for artwork that is also installed permanently in the space while the artist is not present. Note: open flame is not allowed in this space.<br/><br/>Window Residencies. <br/>Artists may propose an activation project. This can include being present in the Window Gallery during certain hours to showcase their making process or other interactive opportunities for visitors to UrbanGlass. The artist must include in their proposal an explanation of what artwork will be installed permanently in the space while the artist is not present.<br/><br/>To apply, please submit: a proposal, your resume or CV, exhibition design using the Window Gallery map below, exhibition budget draft, 5 images, and an image list.<br/><br/>Details of materials for applications:<br/><br/>Proposal, one page long in PDF format, that outlines your intent for an exhibition in the Window Gallery.

In keeping with the theme of Woman\u2019s History Month, the focus is mainly feminist-centric, but, the call also seeks to include works that highlight adjacent movements and concerns to those of women and feminism, which notably have a history of engaging in self-examination. Artists and creatives, individual or collective, of all genders, nationalities, and mediums- visual arts, video, sound art, text, and poetry are encouraged to apply.<br/> <br/>During this very uncertain time of increasing divisiveness in the country and the world, the remembrance of the Suffragette Movement could serve as a cautionary tale on the struggle and preservation of human rights. The Nineteenth Amendment all too frequently is viewed only <br/>in its decisive moment of victory, a fait accompli, glossing over its problematic and arduous progression towards ratification and the current day disenfranchisement and oppression that continue to threaten many here and abroad.<br/><br/>Rather than striking with defensive declarations of -We Are- that flatten conversation and knowledge, this exhibition looks to the heart of our cultural and political clashes where the question of -Who are We- resides. <br/><br/>Artists are in a unique position to ask this question through their work; politics in art is not limited merely to statement-making. Art offers us the opportunity to explore how we understand and apprehend our worlds, the manifold methods of communication that may reveal otherwise untold perceptions, and exposure of a creative process the vulnerability of which is an invitation to the shared meanings that are the underpinnings of every society.", "Website": "http://www.licartists.org", "Country": "United States", "url": "https://www.nyfa.org/Opportunities/Show/cd72afce-4a05-4926-9edb-591641fe6310", "Application Deadline": "02/10/2020", "Organization": "LiC-A @ The Plaxall Gallery", "Application Fee": "$25.00"}, "154": {"Title": "The Creative Time Emerging Artist Open Call", "Location": "New York, NY", "timestamp": "2020-01-22 19:29:38", "Opportunity Type": "Call for Entry/Open Call", "Application Instructions": "Submission Guidelines:<br/>Applications are accepted electronically via Submittable.

The DTour is part of Fermentation Fest - A Live Culture Convergence including classes, workshops, and art events celebrating live culture in all its forms. <br/><br/>The Wormfarm Institute will commission 6-8 original Art Works to be installed along the DTour route. The work will be on public view from September 25-October 4, 2020. We seek artists (individuals or teams) who are interested in creating site-responsive works that engage with the agricultural landscape, the farmers, landowners, and surrounding rural communities. This is an opportunity to contribute to a unique and exciting project with an established reputation for its innovative approach to creative placemaking.<br/><br/>We seek to curate a diverse group of artists for projects that respond to the land on the edge of Wisconsin\u2019s Driftless Region. Successful past projects have ranged from fixed objects, to interactive environments, to work activated by natural processes. Some have invited hands-on participation, utilized existing agricultural infrastructure, or were installed in/on buildings in the small towns along the route. The viewers (DTourists) are usually traveling by car and guided by a map, so proposals should be large-scale and visually compelling. Artists are responsible for both installation and de-installation (volunteer assistance possible) and will have about two weeks to install and one week to de-install. Unless other arrangements are made, artists retain ownership of the work.<br/><br/>This project has been supported by The National Endowment for the Arts, Wisconsin Arts Board, ArtPlace America, The Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts, and The Educational Foundation of America. The Wormfarm Institute, the event\u2019s presenter, is an award-winning non-profit organization with the mission to integrate culture and agriculture along the rural/urban continuum. This will be the 8th year of the DTour (now a biennial) and the first year along a new route.<br/><br/>BUDGET<br/>Wormfarm will fund projects at two levels: $5,000 and $2,500. Six to eight proposals will be selected from a combination of funding levels. Please indicate on your application which funding level you are applying for. <br/>An itemized budget is not required for Phase One.<br/><br/>VISION: \u201cArt Amplifies what landscape quietly asserts\u201d - Max Garland, past Wisconsin Poet Laureate<br/><br/>This project, which began as a celebration of food, farming and rural life, has revealed itself to be a powerful tool for bringing people together across perceived divides. Rooted in an arts and culture focus, we emphasize the cross-sector collaboration necessary to build a vibrant region that values both its rural and urban parts.<br/><br/>In ecology there is a concept called \"edge environments\u201d \u2013 areas between one sort of landscape and another, where ecosystems overlap. These edges tend to have more diversity (and therefore more hardiness) than either of the adjoining environments alone. These mixed-use zones, both literal and conceptual, characterize the DTour experience and allow us to see new possibilities for our land, our work, and our communities.<br/><br/>The DTour is an invitation for people, both rural and urban dwellers, to follow a path and take a closer look at a rural community and landscape where farming plays a central though changing role. <br/><br/>SELECTION PROCESS<br/>Artists will be chosen to participate through a two-part selection process. Initial proposals will be reviewed by a jury consisting of the organizers, past DTour artists, and regional and national arts professionals. Up to 15 finalists will be selected and notified by March 30. Finalists will be expected to attend a two-day Orientation in Sauk County, WI in May.<br/><br/>The Orientation aims to deepen the participants\u2019 understanding of the event, the landscape, the current state of agriculture as well as provide an opportunity for artists to meet with event organizers, landowners, past DTour artists, and one another. The weekend will include a tour of the DTour route, shared meals, and ample opportunity to share ideas and ask questions. Meals and housing will be provided. It is our hope that this experience has value independent of being selected for this year. Participants will receive a stipend to help cover travel expenses and subsequently develop a full proposal. Afterwards, finalists will have two weeks to develop a full proposal.    <br/><br/>SELECTION CRITERIA<br/>- Artistic excellence<br/>- Visual Impact<br/>- Demonstrated ability to realize<br/>- Community Engagement<br/>- Feasibility in the context of the larger event<br/>- Curatorial vision<br/><br/>SUBMISSION REQUIREMENTS<br/>Please respond with: <br/>- One page Letter of Interest including contact information <br/>- Preliminary Project Concept indicating funding level, not to exceed one page <br/>- Concept drawings or visual references <br/>- 8-10 images of applicant\u2019s recent work demonstrating capacity to realize large-scale outdoor project <br/>- Resume or C.V. not to exceed two pages.<br/><br/>Format:<br/>- Letter of Interest, Project Concept, Drawings, Resume/C.V. should be saved as a single PDF or Word doc.<br/>- Images must be JPEG format, \u201chigh\u201d or \u201cfine\u201d quality, not to exceed 2 MB per image. <br/>- Image file names should include artist\u2019s last name and be numbered: \u201cSmith-01.\u201d<br/><br/>Things to keep in mind when developing your proposal:<br/>- Wisconsin weather can be unpredictable, plan for rain, cold & high winds.<br/>- The landscape can dwarf even the most ambitious projects.<br/>- DTour audience interaction ranges from drive-by to direct engagement with installations.

ASPHALT ART ACTIVATIONS \u2013 Request for Qualifications<br/><br/>DOT Art is seeking to identify qualified artists to be included in a registry for potential asphalt art commissions to be implemented between spring and fall 2020. As part of DOT\u2019s efforts to make our streets more pedestrian friendly, the agency continues to reclaim underutilized street space for pedestrian use whether it be a curb extension to create larger waiting areas at corners with a more direct crosswalk; a slip lane closure to encourage pedestrian circulation along the curb line adjacent to a heavily trafficked sidewalk; or an entire street transformation from that of a thoroughfare for cars into an active public space for pedestrians to stop and linger. To highlight these infrastructure changes, DOT Art is partnering with internal teams to commission temporary art treatments that will be painted onto repurposed asphalt street spaces transforming them from ordinary asphalt spaces into canvases for art. DOT Art will provide selected artists with up to twenty thousand dollars ($20,000) towards direct project costs associated with designing, installing, maintaining and removing the Artwork. Artists should submit an application with samples of past work by Friday, February 21, 2020 to be considered for projects this spring.<br/><br/><br/><br/>2. BARRIER BEAUTIFICATION \u2013 Request for Proposals<br/><br/>DOT Art invites artists and designers to propose mural designs as part of the Barrier Beautification initiative. In 2020, as part of DOT\u2019s Green Wave Plan to improve safety for cyclists citywide, DOT will increase implementation of protected bicycle lanes by 20 miles. With a total of 30 miles projected for execution in 2020, DOT Art seeks to highlight the new safety initiative with the installation of painted designs onto jersey barriers enclosing protected bike lanes. Up to five protected bike lanes will be selected as priority locations for Barrier Beautification in spring 2020.

His work employs carefully conceived structural processes, combining cutting edge digital technologies with custom craftsmanship, all grounded in empirical knowledge and experimentation.  Natural geometries and systems - plant spores, seashells, honeycombs \u2013 inspire his sculptures; and through his unique process of packing and stacking of conic and cylindrical steel forms, simple rules give rise to extraordinary complexity.  Godfrey completed his undergraduate work at Yale University, was a member of the inaugural group of CORE Fellows at the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston, and received his MFA from Edinburgh College of Art, Edinburgh, Scotland.  Godfrey has received numerous grants and fellowships, including the National Endowment for the Arts Artist\u2019s Fellowship, the New York Foundation for the Arts Artists Fellowship, the Japan Foundation Artist\u2019s Fellowship, and the Louis Comfort Tiffany Foundation Artist Fellowship.  He also served as a Senior Advisor for the Terre Foundation of American Art\u2019s program in Giverny, France.

Research outputs (drawings, renderings, photographs, video, text, interviews, maquettes, mark-ups et. al) will be exhibited in the JCAL Miller Gallery, from May 14 through July 10th 2021. <br/><br/>Depending on available funding, the artists will receive additional support of up to $2,500 to materialize their visions of creating new, site-specific, public artworks, and present their project to the public in the physical site proposed, along with related programming in 2021. A published print catalog will be produced and distributed both on- and offline following the exhibition in 2021. <br/><br/>With dedicated support for under-recognized artists and disenfranchised arts communities, a total of 15 artist research projects that meaningfully explore the themes of Jamaica Flux will be selected by the Curatorial Team, with support from an Art Advisory and Community Committee. Selected artists will be required to attend three meetings with the Jamaica Flux team and a variety of community members for research guidance from June - December 2020 (meeting dates TBD). <br/><br/>About Jamaica Flux<br/>With the intent to build equity and expand cultural inclusion throughout Southeast Queens, Jamaica Flux strives to commission and present art that involves the local community and creates changes in behavior and policy while also documenting the developments and contradictions that arise in the process. Informed by the local economy, history, cultural traditions, community stakeholders, and participating artists, Jamaica Flux 2021 is dedicated to advancing research and visual and performative actions that foster social change, critical public discourse on advocacy, policy change, economic growth, collective civic action, and community engagement. The project aims to bring artists, local residents, curators, scholars, community leaders, developers, and politicians together to catalyze the trans-formative power of the visual arts, building on the cultural legacy of Jamaica while addressing the challenges of a quickly growing local economy. <br/><br/>Jamaica is a formerly dis-invested community that is on the cusp of dramatic change. The de Blasio administration\u2019s Jamaica Planning Initiative aims to make the downtown area a showplace for its place-based, community-oriented housing and economic development policies. The Jamaica Rezoning Plan, approved in 2017, has further stimulated the private investment and the rise of several global chain hotels and businesses that are gearing up to open in the next few years. These developments have precipitated a critical time of rapid change in Jamaica as a neighborhood. <br/><br/>Success from past editions of Jamaica Flux includes raising dialogues within the local community on urban development, wellness, education, traditional or interdisciplinary art forms, fair trade issues, and small business development. Throughout the past four iterations, artists have undertaken diverse projects, from large-scale public installations, including an environmental oasis in a former litter depot; to interactive projects, including workshops on potato ecology, SAT tutoring, CGI/AR videos, walking audio tours, and mobile paper-making on the street; to paintings acquired by restaurants after the exhibition\u2019s run. Participating artists and collectives from previous iterations of Jamaica Flux (2004, 2007, 2010, 2016) include Alicia Grull\u00f3n, Lily & Honglei, Christopher K. Ho, Ellie Irons and Dan Phiffer, Center for Urban Pedagogy, John Locke & Joaquin Reyes, Olu Oguibe, Michael Rakowitz, Hank Willis Thomas, Juana Valdes to Saya Woolfalk, among many others. <br/><br/>About Jamaica Center for Arts and Learning<br/>The Jamaica Center for Arts and Learning (JCAL) organizes the 5th edition of Jamaica Flux with the strategic vision of empowering Jamaica as a stronghold for the advancement of contemporary art. Founded in 1972 as part of the large-scale effort to revitalize the declining Jamaica business district, JCAL is a multidisciplinary urban arts center in the diverse community of Southeast Queens, NY, dedicated to offering quality visual, performing, and literary arts, and to providing accessible educational programs to encourage participation in the arts.", "Website": "http://www.jcal.org", "Country": "United States", "url": "https://www.nyfa.org/Opportunities/Show/2f718e41-db1a-4565-9f1a-087f00a63b74", "Application Deadline": "03/28/2020", "Organization": "Jamaica Center for Arts and Learning", "Application Fee": " "}, "182": {"Title": "Mobius Photo Spring Landscape Competition", "Location": "Brooklyn, NY", "timestamp": "2020-02-07 19:30:06", "Opportunity Type": "Call for Entry/Open Call", "Application Instructions": "Apply at <a href=\"https://www.jotform.com/MobiusPhoto/spring-2020-landscape-submission\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.jotform.com</a>", "ID": "4ae0ca51-98b8-4573-8c1f-c9bb9f5b92d2", "Opportunity Discipline": "Photography", "Description": "We are looking forward to seeing stunning images from all around the world.

It is often described as unbounded or unlimited; of being beyond in some capacity. Most people equate great art with great beauty. But it is untrue that only beautiful things can be great. The sublime itself goes beyond beauty. It can inspire both awe and fear and provokes feelings of transcendence, precisely why it is often used to describe great works of art or the awesomeness of our natural world. The 18th century author Joseph Addison identified three pleasures of the imagination: greatness, uncommonness, and beauty. For the 2020 edition of our Open Call - a noteworthy election year here in the United States - we will consider submissions that evoke a sense of greatness, and of what our expectation of greatness truly can be. Whether physical, moral, intellectual, spiritual, or otherwise, we seek to learn your vision of the remarkable and the unique. We\u2019re ready to overcome fears, move beyond the status quo, and let greatness shine bright. Artists creating works that inspire awe, push boundaries, incite both a sense of horror and attraction, or otherwise go beyond our comfort zone are encouraged to apply.<br/><br/>Acceptable Artwork:<br/>Painting, photography, prints, works on paper, 3D sculpture, fiber arts, sound, and video. All works on paper (including photography) MUST be in a non-ornamental frame - either white, black, or light wood -  unless explicit reasoning as to otherwise can be presented. Explanation can only relate to the content or aesthetic of the work. Artwork must be no larger than 36 inches in any direction, no longer than 2 min in length, and weigh no more than 20 lbs.     <br/><br/>About PARADICE PALASE:<br/>We are a curatorial project based in Brooklyn, NY that confronts limitations in the art world by championing an artist-first, community-minded and inclusive model.

One of the most essential elements in art is line. But what makes line essential? And what is essential in any line that is made with paint, pencil, string, ink, wire, thread, hair, rope, paper or any other material? And if a work of art has 1, 20, 46, or 100 lines, which of them can be said to be essential and why?

An avid collector himself, he had the idea of mounting exhibits so that employees, business visitors and the general public could be intellectually stimulated by changing exhibitions.\u00a0\u00a0He found that the employees felt a part of something, which added to their quality of life. This continues today. <br/>Art Spaces @ Krasdale is a non-for-profit exhibition space.<br/><br/>-The exhibition will be on view from mid-May until mid-August at Krasdale\u2019s Hunts Point Distribution Offices  and then travel to the Krasdale\u2019s Executive Headquarters in White Plains through mid-November.<br/>-The exhibition will be composed of 2-dimensional work that is hung from picture railing using monofilament.<br/><br/>CURATOR<br/>Kirsten Kucer director and curator for Art Spaces @ Krasdale<br/><br/>HONORARIUMS, FEES and ART SALES<br/>All selected artist will be given a honorarium of $100.
