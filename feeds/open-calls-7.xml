From the start, we caught flack from the art establishment when we broke down barriers and opened the gates to everyone from serious long-time art collectors to people who just love art and never thought they‚Äôd collect. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As it turned out, nobody cared about the art world and their politics. Our open and transparent approach worked: imaginations have been sparked and countless new collections have been jump-started at Superfine! fairs as we continue to spread our message of a more inclusive art market across the country. Since 2015, we‚Äôve had one goal: produce badass, expertly curated art shows where √ºber-talented, diverse global artists meet their new fans in iconic locations across the US and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;===== INSTRUCTIONS =====&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Have questions?

One of the most essential elements in art is line. But what makes line essential? And what is essential in any line that is made with paint, pencil, string, ink, wire, thread, hair, rope, paper or any other material? And if a work of art has 1, 20, 46, or 100 lines, which of them can be said to be essential and why? These are the kind of questions The Essential Line will explore through the work of art. &lt;br/&gt;The Exhibition is open to artists in the Hudson Valley, the New York Metro area and Westchester County. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ABOUT THE VENUE&lt;br/&gt;Works are hung in brightly lit foyers, executive offices and hallways enriching the day-to-day experience of all the employees. In 1984 Sig Balka, then general counsel at Krasdale Foods, founded Krasdale Galleries, now Art Spaces @ Krasdale. An avid collector himself, he had the idea of mounting exhibits so that employees, business visitors and the general public could be intellectually stimulated by changing exhibitions.¬†¬†He found that the employees felt a part of something, which added to their quality of life. This continues today. &lt;br/&gt;Art Spaces @ Krasdale is a non-for-profit exhibition space.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-The exhibition will be on view from mid-May until mid-August at Krasdale‚Äôs Hunts Point Distribution Offices  and then travel to the Krasdale‚Äôs Executive Headquarters in White Plains through mid-November.&lt;br/&gt;-The exhibition will be composed of 2-dimensional work that is hung from picture railing using monofilament.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CURATOR&lt;br/&gt;Kirsten Kucer director and curator for Art Spaces @ Krasdale&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;HONORARIUMS, FEES and ART SALES&lt;br/&gt;All selected artist will be given a honorarium of $100. There is no entry fee or sales commission. All sales will be made through direct contact between the client and the artist.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;EXTRAS &lt;br/&gt;A color catalogued is produced for each exhibition. A reception will be held at the White Plains office with access afterwards by appointment there and at the Hunts Point Distribution Center. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SHIPPPING&lt;br/&gt;Artists living in the New York metro area will have their work shipped and returned by Art Spaces @ Krasdale. Artists in the Hudson Valley will need to bring their art to Beacon, NY. It will be shipped to Art Spaces @ Krasdale  from Beacon and returned to Beacon. Westchester artists will need to bring their work to the White Plains office.¬†All  work will be insured with the shipper and while at Art Spaces @ Krasdale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;===== INSTRUCTIONS =====&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SUBMISSION REQUIREMENTS &lt;br/&gt;IMAGES &lt;br/&gt;-Please submit up to 10 images.

This year‚Äôs theme is "the sublime", and we'll be considering works that inspire awe, push boundaries, incite both a sense of horror and attraction, or otherwise go beyond our comfort zone. This year's guest juror is founder and director of Gloria's Project Space, Lauren Wolchik. We are seeking works from emerging and underrepresented artists 18 years+ who live in the United States and currently do not have gallery representation. Please read below for the show prompt, full eligibility, and more details, plus how to apply!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a juried show with a 1st place award of $300 USD plus 6-months of supporter benefits with us at PARADICE PALASE.

It is often described as unbounded or unlimited; of being beyond in some capacity. Most people equate great art with great beauty. But it is untrue that only beautiful things can be great. The sublime itself goes beyond beauty. It can inspire both awe and fear and provokes feelings of transcendence, precisely why it is often used to describe great works of art or the awesomeness of our natural world. The 18th century author Joseph Addison identified three pleasures of the imagination: greatness, uncommonness, and beauty. For the 2020 edition of our Open Call - a noteworthy election year here in the United States - we will consider submissions that evoke a sense of greatness, and of what our expectation of greatness truly can be. Whether physical, moral, intellectual, spiritual, or otherwise, we seek to learn your vision of the remarkable and the unique. We‚Äôre ready to overcome fears, move beyond the status quo, and let greatness shine bright. Artists creating works that inspire awe, push boundaries, incite both a sense of horror and attraction, or otherwise go beyond our comfort zone are encouraged to apply.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Acceptable Artwork:&lt;br/&gt;Painting, photography, prints, works on paper, 3D sculpture, fiber arts, sound, and video. All works on paper (including photography) MUST be in a non-ornamental frame - either white, black, or light wood -  unless explicit reasoning as to otherwise can be presented. Explanation can only relate to the content or aesthetic of the work. Artwork must be no larger than 36 inches in any direction, no longer than 2 min in length, and weigh no more than 20 lbs.     &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;About PARADICE PALASE:&lt;br/&gt;We are a curatorial project based in Brooklyn, NY that confronts limitations in the art world by championing an artist-first, community-minded and inclusive model.

Research outputs (drawings, renderings, photographs, video, text, interviews, maquettes, mark-ups et. al) will be exhibited in the JCAL Miller Gallery, from May 14 through July 10th 2021. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Depending on available funding, the artists will receive additional support of up to $2,500 to materialize their visions of creating new, site-specific, public artworks, and present their project to the public in the physical site proposed, along with related programming in 2021. A published print catalog will be produced and distributed both on- and offline following the exhibition in 2021. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With dedicated support for under-recognized artists and disenfranchised arts communities, a total of 15 artist research projects that meaningfully explore the themes of Jamaica Flux will be selected by the Curatorial Team, with support from an Art Advisory and Community Committee. Selected artists will be required to attend three meetings with the Jamaica Flux team and a variety of community members for research guidance from June - December 2020 (meeting dates TBD). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;About Jamaica Flux&lt;br/&gt;With the intent to build equity and expand cultural inclusion throughout Southeast Queens, Jamaica Flux strives to commission and present art that involves the local community and creates changes in behavior and policy while also documenting the developments and contradictions that arise in the process. Informed by the local economy, history, cultural traditions, community stakeholders, and participating artists, Jamaica Flux 2021 is dedicated to advancing research and visual and performative actions that foster social change, critical public discourse on advocacy, policy change, economic growth, collective civic action, and community engagement. The project aims to bring artists, local residents, curators, scholars, community leaders, developers, and politicians together to catalyze the trans-formative power of the visual arts, building on the cultural legacy of Jamaica while addressing the challenges of a quickly growing local economy. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Jamaica is a formerly dis-invested community that is on the cusp of dramatic change. The de Blasio administration‚Äôs Jamaica Planning Initiative aims to make the downtown area a showplace for its place-based, community-oriented housing and economic development policies. The Jamaica Rezoning Plan, approved in 2017, has further stimulated the private investment and the rise of several global chain hotels and businesses that are gearing up to open in the next few years. These developments have precipitated a critical time of rapid change in Jamaica as a neighborhood. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Success from past editions of Jamaica Flux includes raising dialogues within the local community on urban development, wellness, education, traditional or interdisciplinary art forms, fair trade issues, and small business development. Throughout the past four iterations, artists have undertaken diverse projects, from large-scale public installations, including an environmental oasis in a former litter depot; to interactive projects, including workshops on potato ecology, SAT tutoring, CGI/AR videos, walking audio tours, and mobile paper-making on the street; to paintings acquired by restaurants after the exhibition‚Äôs run. Participating artists and collectives from previous iterations of Jamaica Flux (2004, 2007, 2010, 2016) include Alicia Grull√≥n, Lily &amp; Honglei, Christopher K. Ho, Ellie Irons and Dan Phiffer, Center for Urban Pedagogy, John Locke &amp; Joaquin Reyes, Olu Oguibe, Michael Rakowitz, Hank Willis Thomas, Juana Valdes to Saya Woolfalk, among many others. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;About Jamaica Center for Arts and Learning&lt;br/&gt;The Jamaica Center for Arts and Learning (JCAL) organizes the 5th edition of Jamaica Flux with the strategic vision of empowering Jamaica as a stronghold for the advancement of contemporary art. Founded in 1972 as part of the large-scale effort to revitalize the declining Jamaica business district, JCAL is a multidisciplinary urban arts center in the diverse community of Southeast Queens, NY, dedicated to offering quality visual, performing, and literary arts, and to providing accessible educational programs to encourage participation in the arts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;===== INSTRUCTIONS =====&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Application Instructions / Contact Information&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Proposals must include:&lt;br/&gt;‚Ä¢ 1-page condensed resume with current contact information&lt;br/&gt;‚Ä¢ 1-page statement describing the artist‚Äôs work in general&lt;br/&gt;‚Ä¢ Project proposal (no more than 2 pages)&lt;br/&gt;A detailed description of the research to be undertaken, answering the following questions &lt;br/&gt;What topic(s) of research do you plan to undertake?&lt;br/&gt;What is the relationship between the research, site, and Jamaica, Queens as a neighborhood? &lt;br/&gt;What impacts does your realized project hope to achieve? &lt;br/&gt;In what visual and physical forms will your research manifest? &lt;br/&gt;How will you use the funds allotted to you in the undertaking of this research?&lt;br/&gt;Proposed supplemental program(s) or event(s) &lt;br/&gt;‚Ä¢ 6 images of previous work supporting your proposal; each image should be labeled.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All materials must be received by Saturday, March 28th, 2020, 11:59PM.

His work employs carefully conceived structural processes, combining cutting edge digital technologies with custom craftsmanship, all grounded in empirical knowledge and experimentation.  Natural geometries and systems - plant spores, seashells, honeycombs ‚Äì inspire his sculptures; and through his unique process of packing and stacking of conic and cylindrical steel forms, simple rules give rise to extraordinary complexity.  Godfrey completed his undergraduate work at Yale University, was a member of the inaugural group of CORE Fellows at the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston, and received his MFA from Edinburgh College of Art, Edinburgh, Scotland.  Godfrey has received numerous grants and fellowships, including the National Endowment for the Arts Artist‚Äôs Fellowship, the New York Foundation for the Arts Artists Fellowship, the Japan Foundation Artist‚Äôs Fellowship, and the Louis Comfort Tiffany Foundation Artist Fellowship.  He also served as a Senior Advisor for the Terre Foundation of American Art‚Äôs program in Giverny, France.  Godfrey‚Äôs work can be found in several private and public collections including the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston, the Brooklyn Museum, the deCordova Museum and Sculpture Park, and Art OMI.  His commissioned work includes Capital, in Seattle, WA; Concordia for Lexarts, Lexington, KY; Quake, Cambridge Arts Council, Cambridge, MA; Enspire Traverse City, MI, and installations at Frederik Meijer Garden and Sculpture Park, Grand Rapids, MI; The DeCordova Museum and Sculpture Park, Lincoln, MA; and the Kennedy Art Museum, Ohio University, Athens, OH.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Jaroslava Prihodova is a visual artist, designer, and curator interested in interdisciplinary topics and collaborations. Her artistic practice generally revolves around issues associated with the object. "I spent most of my informative years developing language that sufficiently translates my ideas into a material. Being a maker, I tend to explore ideas and their application across disciplines. As a result, I am continually searching for a balance between two core doctrines: design, science, and fine art. In many instances, this schism creates a climate for particular limitations with interesting challenges." Prihodova received her BFA from School of Art and Design, Studio of Natural Materials, Jan Evangelista Purkyne University, Usti nad Labem, Czech Republic, and MFA from School of Visual and Performing Arts, Jewelry and Metalsmithing, Syracuse University, NY. She now works as the director of the Dowd Gallery at SUNY Cortland, NY. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Entry Fee&lt;br/&gt;The entry fee is $35.00 and includes membership at the Art Center for February-December 2020.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;===== INSTRUCTIONS =====&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For More Information&lt;br/&gt;If you have any questions, please contact Davana Robedee at mail@schweinfurthartcenter.org. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Professional artists 18 years old &amp; up residing in New York State may submit digital images of no more than two pieces completed within the last three years (2017 and after) and not previously exhibited at the Art Center.&lt;br/&gt;Two and three dimensional work will be accepted including, but not limited to, photography, sculpture, ceramics, painting, drawing, fiber, installation, and video.

Detroit Art Week is an annual celebration of contemporary art in Detroit. In 2008, Detroit Art Week Co-Founder Amani Olu, established Young Curators, New Ideas to promote and support emerging curatorial practices. Young Curators, New Ideas VI will take place from Wednesday, July 15 to Sunday, July 19, 2020 at Trumbull &amp; Porter Detroit Hotel. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Featuring 12 independent curators, Young Curators, New Ideas VI will shine light on the cultural, artistic, social and political transformations initiated by women, LGBTQ and gender variant people through their creative, and at times independent, curatorial practices. With a sense of relevance and urgency, these multifaceted and dynamic micro-exhibitions consider contemporary issues that exist at the intersection of curatorial practice and artistic production. Within a 320 square-foot hotel room, each curator will present one artist whose work is a thoughtful and provocative exploration on the most pressing issues of our time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;===== INSTRUCTIONS =====&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;GUIDELINES:&lt;br/&gt;- Young Curators, New Ideas is open to exhibition organizers working in all disciplines.&lt;br/&gt;- There is no age restriction.&lt;br/&gt;- We will only accept proposals for one-person exhibitions only. We will not consider proposals for group exhibitions.&lt;br/&gt;- We will give extra consideration to proposals that fit the exhibition's theme of inclusion and diversity and engage viewers in a thoughtful and provocative discussion on the most pressing issues of our time. Young Curators, New Ideas VI will not only privilege historically oppressed and institutionally underrepresented voices in curatorship and the global art market, but also set the stage to center contemporary artists' perspectives on: gender; sexuality; the body; global migration; the political economy; climate change; war and violence; ethical dilemmas in the development of science and technology; and social stratification and racial hierarchies. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SUBMISSION REQUIREMENTS:&lt;br/&gt;Please visit www.detroitartweek.org/young-curators-new-ideas-vi-open-call for our complete requirements, as well as, additional information and FAQs.

ASPHALT ART ACTIVATIONS ‚Äì Request for Qualifications&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;DOT Art is seeking to identify qualified artists to be included in a registry for potential asphalt art commissions to be implemented between spring and fall 2020. As part of DOT‚Äôs efforts to make our streets more pedestrian friendly, the agency continues to reclaim underutilized street space for pedestrian use whether it be a curb extension to create larger waiting areas at corners with a more direct crosswalk; a slip lane closure to encourage pedestrian circulation along the curb line adjacent to a heavily trafficked sidewalk; or an entire street transformation from that of a thoroughfare for cars into an active public space for pedestrians to stop and linger. To highlight these infrastructure changes, DOT Art is partnering with internal teams to commission temporary art treatments that will be painted onto repurposed asphalt street spaces transforming them from ordinary asphalt spaces into canvases for art. DOT Art will provide selected artists with up to twenty thousand dollars ($20,000) towards direct project costs associated with designing, installing, maintaining and removing the Artwork. Artists should submit an application with samples of past work by Friday, February 21, 2020 to be considered for projects this spring.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2. BARRIER BEAUTIFICATION ‚Äì Request for Proposals&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;DOT Art invites artists and designers to propose mural designs as part of the Barrier Beautification initiative. In 2020, as part of DOT‚Äôs Green Wave Plan to improve safety for cyclists citywide, DOT will increase implementation of protected bicycle lanes by 20 miles. With a total of 30 miles projected for execution in 2020, DOT Art seeks to highlight the new safety initiative with the installation of painted designs onto jersey barriers enclosing protected bike lanes. Up to five protected bike lanes will be selected as priority locations for Barrier Beautification in spring 2020. A $3,000 design fee will be awarded to selected artists to finalize design, prepare stencils and oversee painting onto the barriers by volunteers one day in the spring. DOT will also cover costs for all paint and supplies. Artists should submit an application, design proposal and samples of past work by Friday, February 14, 2020 for consideration.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Application Instructions/Public Contact Information:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Download the Asphalt Art Activations Application here: &lt;br/&gt;https://www1.nyc.gov/html/dot/downloads/pdf/asphalt-art-rfq-2020.pdf&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Download the Barrier Beautification Application here:&lt;br/&gt;https://www1.nyc.gov/html/dot/downloads/pdf/barrier-beautification-rfp-2020.pdf&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Questions should be emailed to arts@dot.nyc.gov.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;===== INSTRUCTIONS =====&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Download the Asphalt Art Activations Application here: &lt;br/&gt;https://www1.nyc.gov/html/dot/downloads/pdf/asphalt-art-rfq-2020.pdf&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Download the Barrier Beautification Application here:&lt;br/&gt;https://www1.nyc.gov/html/dot/downloads/pdf/barrier-beautification-rfp-2020.pdf&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Questions should be emailed to arts@dot.nyc.gov.&lt;/p&gt;</content><link href="https://www.nyfa.org/Opportunities/Show/36c0855e-cd1d-45b4-9e05-1004ca96d35c" rel="alternate"/></entry><entry><id>8ea9c352-224d-493b-94be-3911ab7b0b5f</id><title>2/5 - FUTURES</title><updated>2020-02-18T19:30:24.115658+00:00</updated><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Studio Place Arts&lt;br/&gt;üìç Barre, VT, United States&lt;br/&gt;üé® All Visual Arts&lt;br/&gt;üìÖ 02/05/2020 deadline&lt;br/&gt;üí∞ $10.00 fee&lt;br/&gt;‚û° &lt;a href="http://www.studioplacearts.com"&gt;Apply&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;====== DESCRIPTION ======&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Science fiction artists often predict the future and its technology with surprising,and sometimes alarming accuracy.  Space travel, electric vehicles, cloning and AI - these and many more made appearances in the art of science fiction long before they were realities.  This show invites artists to share works of science fiction, in traditional and non-traditional media.  Whether your vision warns us of apocalyptic consequences of our actions, or offers innovative solutions for the problems of the modern world; whether your vision is based in science and technology, or borrows heavily from fiction, we want to see it!  Ultimately, science fiction poses, and sometimes answers the question of who we are and where we may be going.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;===== INSTRUCTIONS =====&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To submit a proposal to the show, send:&lt;br/&gt;digital image(s) [limit to no more than 8];&lt;br/&gt;complete description of images (size of work, medium, date, price);&lt;br/&gt;contact information of artist;&lt;br/&gt;brief artist statement.&lt;/p&gt;</content><link href="https://www.nyfa.org/Opportunities/Show/8ea9c352-224d-493b-94be-3911ab7b0b5f" rel="alternate"/></entry><entry><id>11ebcb93-945d-49e3-ae98-5ba0c18ccbd3</id><title>2/11 - $550.00 Innovate Grants ‚Äì Call for Artists + Photographers</title><updated>2020-02-18T19:30:24.115628+00:00</updated><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Innovate Grant&lt;br/&gt;üìç  , N/A&lt;br/&gt;üé® All Disciplines&lt;br/&gt;üìÖ 02/11/2020 deadline&lt;br/&gt;üí∞ $25.00 fee&lt;br/&gt;‚û° &lt;a href="https://innovateartistgrants.org"&gt;Apply&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;====== DESCRIPTION ======&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Innovate Grant is now accepting submissions for the Winter Cycle.

Since its inception our organization has continued to incorporate drawing-based programming, including education (Drawing Center), publications (INDA), and gallery exhibits into the broader spectrum of its projects. The artists who formed Manifest in 2004 knew that despite their diverging career paths (architecture, art history, painting, industrial design, photography)¬†they were brought together because of their connection to drawing and their mutually intense but multi-faceted pursuit of this fundamental discipline.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In honor of the original spirit of the founding ideals of Manifest, the gallery launched DRAWN as a new annual exhibition project marking the organization's 10th season. DRAWN seeks to survey and present the broad scope of drawing being made today.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;$40 for up to FOUR entries submitted. $5 per each additional entry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;===== INSTRUCTIONS =====&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To view the full prospectus and entry form visit &lt;a href="http://www.manifestgallery.org/drawn." target="_blank"&gt;http://www.manifestgallery.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Email info@manifestgallery.org with questions.&lt;/p&gt;</content><link href="https://www.nyfa.org/Opportunities/Show/c30e5809-4419-4c34-a4b0-1f5012d1f505" rel="alternate"/></entry><entry><id>c363cb9e-2373-4b24-a87a-7c79183964ab</id><title>1/31 - Call For ArtTable Fellowship Proposals</title><updated>2020-02-18T19:30:24.115543+00:00</updated><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;ArtTable&lt;br/&gt;üìç  , N/A&lt;br/&gt;üé® All Visual Arts&lt;br/&gt;üìÖ 01/31/2020 deadline&lt;br/&gt;üí∞ unknown fee&lt;br/&gt;‚û° &lt;a href="http://bit.ly/ATFellowship2020"&gt;Apply&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;====== DESCRIPTION ======&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ArtTable is currently soliciting proposals from arts organizations and institutions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For 20 years, the ArtTable Fellowship program has addressed the marked lack of diversity in arts employment. The objective is to provide quality real work experiences and mentorship for women identifying graduate/pre/post-doc students and emerging professionals from backgrounds generally underrepresented in the field to aid their transition from academic to professional careers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Through one-on-one mentoring relationships with ArtTable members, every year, a selected number of fellows have the opportunity to work with an established leader in the field and gain exposure to a range of professional activities at first class cultural institutions throughout a five to eight week period during the summer. Each fellow will be connected with an ArtTable 'mentor' for the duration of their fellowship and be awarded a $4,000 stipend for the five to eight-week commitment during the summer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The program was established in 2000 as a conscious effort to enrich and strengthen the visual arts field by supporting an inclusive and diverse professional landscape. The ArtTable Fellowship is one of the longest-standing programs supporting diversity in the visual arts. The mentored fellowships introduce emerging women-identifying professionals to the range of professional career tracks in the visual arts, including but not limited to: curatorial, education, public programming, archival research and collections management. ArtTable has already supported eighty-five fellows around the country.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ArtTable is soliciting proposals from arts organizations and institutions that meet the following criteria:&lt;br/&gt;‚Ä¢	Enable the fellow to work collaboratively as well as independently on a focused and cohesive project that significantly contributes to a public exhibition or program initiatives&lt;br/&gt;‚Ä¢	Offer opportunities to expand their research, writing, communication and project management skills&lt;br/&gt;‚Ä¢	Provide integration into the institution's staff and interface with other departments for maximum experience and exposure to day-to-day activities&lt;br/&gt;‚Ä¢	Encourage working closely with and receiving consistent direct supervision from a designated mentor&lt;br/&gt;‚Ä¢	Have a take-away component, be it research or skills-based with recognition given for contributions made to a major current or forthcoming project or program&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This year, ArtTable will accept proposals from host institutions through January 31, 2020.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The ArtTable Fellowship program is made possible thanks to the invaluable support of individuals and foundations.

The DTour is part of Fermentation Fest - A Live Culture Convergence including classes, workshops, and art events celebrating live culture in all its forms. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Wormfarm Institute will commission 6-8 original Art Works to be installed along the DTour route. The work will be on public view from September 25-October 4, 2020. We seek artists (individuals or teams) who are interested in creating site-responsive works that engage with the agricultural landscape, the farmers, landowners, and surrounding rural communities. This is an opportunity to contribute to a unique and exciting project with an established reputation for its innovative approach to creative placemaking.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We seek to curate a diverse group of artists for projects that respond to the land on the edge of Wisconsin‚Äôs Driftless Region. Successful past projects have ranged from fixed objects, to interactive environments, to work activated by natural processes. Some have invited hands-on participation, utilized existing agricultural infrastructure, or were installed in/on buildings in the small towns along the route. The viewers (DTourists) are usually traveling by car and guided by a map, so proposals should be large-scale and visually compelling. Artists are responsible for both installation and de-installation (volunteer assistance possible) and will have about two weeks to install and one week to de-install. Unless other arrangements are made, artists retain ownership of the work.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project has been supported by The National Endowment for the Arts, Wisconsin Arts Board, ArtPlace America, The Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts, and The Educational Foundation of America. The Wormfarm Institute, the event‚Äôs presenter, is an award-winning non-profit organization with the mission to integrate culture and agriculture along the rural/urban continuum. This will be the 8th year of the DTour (now a biennial) and the first year along a new route.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BUDGET&lt;br/&gt;Wormfarm will fund projects at two levels: $5,000 and $2,500. Six to eight proposals will be selected from a combination of funding levels. Please indicate on your application which funding level you are applying for. &lt;br/&gt;An itemized budget is not required for Phase One.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;VISION: ‚ÄúArt Amplifies what landscape quietly asserts‚Äù - Max Garland, past Wisconsin Poet Laureate&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project, which began as a celebration of food, farming and rural life, has revealed itself to be a powerful tool for bringing people together across perceived divides. Rooted in an arts and culture focus, we emphasize the cross-sector collaboration necessary to build a vibrant region that values both its rural and urban parts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In ecology there is a concept called "edge environments‚Äù ‚Äì areas between one sort of landscape and another, where ecosystems overlap. These edges tend to have more diversity (and therefore more hardiness) than either of the adjoining environments alone. These mixed-use zones, both literal and conceptual, characterize the DTour experience and allow us to see new possibilities for our land, our work, and our communities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The DTour is an invitation for people, both rural and urban dwellers, to follow a path and take a closer look at a rural community and landscape where farming plays a central though changing role. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SELECTION PROCESS&lt;br/&gt;Artists will be chosen to participate through a two-part selection process. Initial proposals will be reviewed by a jury consisting of the organizers, past DTour artists, and regional and national arts professionals. Up to 15 finalists will be selected and notified by March 30. Finalists will be expected to attend a two-day Orientation in Sauk County, WI in May.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Orientation aims to deepen the participants‚Äô understanding of the event, the landscape, the current state of agriculture as well as provide an opportunity for artists to meet with event organizers, landowners, past DTour artists, and one another. The weekend will include a tour of the DTour route, shared meals, and ample opportunity to share ideas and ask questions. Meals and housing will be provided. It is our hope that this experience has value independent of being selected for this year. Participants will receive a stipend to help cover travel expenses and subsequently develop a full proposal. Afterwards, finalists will have two weeks to develop a full proposal.    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SELECTION CRITERIA&lt;br/&gt;- Artistic excellence&lt;br/&gt;- Visual Impact&lt;br/&gt;- Demonstrated ability to realize&lt;br/&gt;- Community Engagement&lt;br/&gt;- Feasibility in the context of the larger event&lt;br/&gt;- Curatorial vision&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SUBMISSION REQUIREMENTS&lt;br/&gt;Please respond with: &lt;br/&gt;- One page Letter of Interest including contact information &lt;br/&gt;- Preliminary Project Concept indicating funding level, not to exceed one page &lt;br/&gt;- Concept drawings or visual references &lt;br/&gt;- 8-10 images of applicant‚Äôs recent work demonstrating capacity to realize large-scale outdoor project &lt;br/&gt;- Resume or C.V. not to exceed two pages.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Format:&lt;br/&gt;- Letter of Interest, Project Concept, Drawings, Resume/C.V. should be saved as a single PDF or Word doc.&lt;br/&gt;- Images must be JPEG format, ‚Äúhigh‚Äù or ‚Äúfine‚Äù quality, not to exceed 2 MB per image. &lt;br/&gt;- Image file names should include artist‚Äôs last name and be numbered: ‚ÄúSmith-01.‚Äù&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Things to keep in mind when developing your proposal:&lt;br/&gt;- Wisconsin weather can be unpredictable, plan for rain, cold &amp; high winds.&lt;br/&gt;- The landscape can dwarf even the most ambitious projects.&lt;br/&gt;- DTour audience interaction ranges from drive-by to direct engagement with installations. Keep both scenarios in mind as you develop your idea.&lt;br/&gt;- The DTour runs primarily along farm fields, but also includes woods, wetlands, and small towns.

In keeping with the theme of Woman‚Äôs History Month, the focus is mainly feminist-centric, but, the call also seeks to include works that highlight adjacent movements and concerns to those of women and feminism, which notably have a history of engaging in self-examination. Artists and creatives, individual or collective, of all genders, nationalities, and mediums- visual arts, video, sound art, text, and poetry are encouraged to apply.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;During this very uncertain time of increasing divisiveness in the country and the world, the remembrance of the Suffragette Movement could serve as a cautionary tale on the struggle and preservation of human rights. The Nineteenth Amendment all too frequently is viewed only &lt;br/&gt;in its decisive moment of victory, a fait accompli, glossing over its problematic and arduous progression towards ratification and the current day disenfranchisement and oppression that continue to threaten many here and abroad.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rather than striking with defensive declarations of -We Are- that flatten conversation and knowledge, this exhibition looks to the heart of our cultural and political clashes where the question of -Who are We- resides. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Artists are in a unique position to ask this question through their work; politics in art is not limited merely to statement-making. Art offers us the opportunity to explore how we understand and apprehend our worlds, the manifold methods of communication that may reveal otherwise untold perceptions, and exposure of a creative process the vulnerability of which is an invitation to the shared meanings that are the underpinnings of every society.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;===== INSTRUCTIONS =====&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To apply please copy and paste the below link into your browser or visit us at www.licartists.org for more information.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;https://licartists.formstack.com/forms/submission_form_social_transformation&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;About the curator:&lt;br/&gt;Lisa di Donato received her BFA from the Rhode Island School of Design.
