Starting from the notion of performance in the visual art practice, the prize is unique in its particular attention to hybrid research, underlining the openness and fluidity of performance, its social and political implications and its level of public understandability. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The nine projects selected by LIVE WORKS will be invited to participate in a production residency at Centrale Fies from the 6th to the 16th July 2019, during which each project will have a budget of € 1.500,00 to contribute to the production of the performance.The production of the performance projects during the residency will be supported by diverse types of curatorship, from theoretical to technical development, a Free School of Performance with Studio visit, critical session and reading group. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The announcement is open to a wide range of emerging performative actions, including: Performances, sound and new media arts, text-based performances, lecture performances, multimedia storytelling, choreographic practices, relational and workshop-based projects, and other projects questioning the idea of performativity beyond the body.&lt;br/&gt;Artists and professionals from any geographic location can enter the Open Call, as individuals or in groups, with a single project. Live Works only accepts unpublished or long-term projects that need to be developed and/or concluded, for which participation would represent an evolution of the project or it’s final chapter.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The performances produced in the residency will be presented during the 39th edition of the Drodesera Festival of Performing Arts (19th, 20th, 21st July 2019).&lt;br/&gt;On this occasion, the nine winning projects will be seen and discussed by a board of international professionals, working for festival, institutions residency and production programs that sustain and produce research in performance. The board will be actively involved in public and private meetings with the nine artists.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For Live Works vol. 7 the guest board of mentors and future network for promotion of the artists is composed by:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Christine Eyene (Artistic Director of 5th International Biennal of Casablanca 2020, Morocco); Elvira Dyangani Ose (Director of The Showroom, London, UK); Hicham Khalidi (Director of Jan Van Eyck Academie, Maastricht, The Netherlands); Ane Rodríguez Armendariz (Cultural Director of Tabakalera, International Centre for Contemporary Culture, Donostia/San Sebastián, Spain); Ash Bulayev (Director of Onassis AiR: (inter)national artistic research residency program, Athens, Greece); Danjel Andersson (Director of Dansehallerne from May 2019, Copenhagen, Denmark)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The nine selected projects can benefit of a further 10-day residency at Centrale Fies in a period between the 1st August and  the 31st December 2019.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;info: liveworks@centralefies.it&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;www.liveworksaward.com&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;===== INSTRUCTIONS =====&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Artists who intend to participate must:&lt;br/&gt;1.

Each iteration of the exhibit brings in hundreds of powerful yet diminutive works for our jury to consider. Inevitably this results in a gallery full of diverse, compelling, and exquisite little gems. Manifest’s patrons eagerly await the Magnitude SEVEN event each year. This annual project is one of the most varied exhibits in our season. So we are always excited to offer this call to artists to submit works no larger than seven inches in any dimension (any proportion).   Standard presentation devices like pedestals, mats, and frames that are not considered part of the work of art are not limited by the 7" criteria.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Unless specified otherwise by the exhibit or project parameters Manifest has no requirements on timeframe when submitted works must have been made.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ANNUAL CASH AWARD: The annual Manifest Grand Jury Prize will result in the awarding of one significant cash prize ($2500) to a single work selected as the 'best of the entire season'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;===== INSTRUCTIONS =====&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To view the full prospectus or to submit work visit &lt;a href="http://www.manifestgallery.org/seven." target="_blank"&gt;http://www.manifestgallery.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For questions please email &lt;a href="http://www.manifestgallery.org/seven." target="_blank"&gt;http://www.manifestgallery.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><link href="https://www.nyfa.org/Opportunities/Show/a9771ba3-58b5-4b56-bbd0-da872caf4d96" rel="alternate"/></entry></feed>
