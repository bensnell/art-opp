Thanks to the hidden connections of ANIMA MUNDI, all the ecosystems of the Earth, before and after the appearance of the mankind, found their equilibrium, their ways to live and to develop themselves, to transform and to evolve. All the beings of the planet, plants, minerals, animals are permeated by a secret force that has always stimulated the human thought and research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The festival aims to discover these multiple forms of hidden connections between the soul and the body, the mankind and the natural elements, the natural spaces and the cities. We invite artists to show their reflections about the various ways in which the ANIMA MUNDI expresses the relationships among all the existing entities and the natural and cultural systems, and to represent by their artistic works the processes of the evolution of the world in which we all live. Artists, designers and architects are invited to talk about ANIMA MUNDI through photo reportage of cities, hidden places, photographic documentaries, personal experiences, presenting their works of photography, painting, sculpture/installation, design and architecture, video-art and live performance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ITSLIQUID Group will begin a charity initiative aimed to support some of the most important no-profit organizations that are internationally involved in the environmental protection, such as United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, Sea Shepherd Conservation Society, One Tree Planted, The Ocean Cleanup and Plastic Oceans. Indeed, they will have some interesting talks during CONSCIOUSNESS and VISIONS, the following ANIMA MUNDI’s appointments. This choice comes from the essence of ANIMA MUNDI in which everything is related to the living entities of the planet.

Easeum clients are commercial real estate managers seeking curated exhibitions in their space(s) featuring inspiring art from individual artists, galleries, grant-giving-foundations, and private collectors. Proceeds from pieces selected for these engagements are shared with art providers, after costs of operations and installation. This is an opportunity to have your collection displayed (and possibly sold) while collecting cash for your participation. All work will be insured.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Easeum is seeking proposals from curators, galleries, and/or artists for exhibitions at three Manhattan Class A Office lobbies/common areas.

Proposals from solo shows all the way to larger group exhibitions will be considered. Each show should have a unique theme apparent to building tenants.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Exhibitions will run for 3+ months in each building before moving to the next. Thus this engagement will range from 9-12 months starting late summer to early fall 2019. Reception events will be held at each location at the beginning of the 3 month period.

Most artists’ works, whether on a conscious or subconscious level, reflect certain personal experiences and histories. References to the past can be monumental, quotidian or intimate. Everyday objects or places take on new meaning depending on how they are interpreted or experienced. In Marcel Proust’s “Remembrance of Things Past,” the smell and taste of a madeleine cake triggers a flood of memories and transports the author to another time and experience in his life. The show will explore the various mnemonic devices artists use to create thought provoking connections and commentaries on the passage of time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Memory can be a very personal journey through one’s own timeline as well as a collective experience of togetherness. We are excited to offer this broad and very thought provoking theme for this exhibit. Work in all media will be considered, including collages or sculptures incorporating everyday found objects.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Juror / Curator: Arianne Faber Kolb, PhD is an art historian and independent curator. She was the Executive Co-Director of the Carriage Barn Arts Center in New Canaan, a curator in the J.Paul Getty Museum’s Paintings and Drawings Departments, and a researcher in the Paintings Department of the Metropolitan Museum of Art. She has curated numerous exhibitions and her published work includes a book on Jan Brueghel the Elder, articles on old master painting, exhibition catalogues of contemporary Cuban art, and two children’s books on New Canaan architecture and history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;===== INSTRUCTIONS =====&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Entry Instructions:	Submitting entries for jurying will all be done through our website, loftartists.org.
