From the start, we caught flack from the art establishment when we broke down barriers and opened the gates to everyone from serious long-time art collectors to people who just love art and never thought they’d collect. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As it turned out, nobody cared about the art world and their politics. Our open and transparent approach worked: imaginations have been sparked and countless new collections have been jump-started at Superfine! fairs as we continue to spread our message of a more inclusive art market across the country. Since 2015, we’ve had one goal: produce badass, expertly curated art shows where über-talented, diverse global artists meet their new fans in iconic locations across the US and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;===== INSTRUCTIONS =====&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://superfine.world/before-you-apply" target="_blank"&gt;https://superfine.world&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;https://superfine.world/exhibit-la&lt;/p&gt;</content><link href="https://www.nyfa.org/Opportunities/Show/d528fa18-8447-44cd-84d3-d77574e728fe" rel="alternate"/></entry><entry><id>fb9b66a8-8cde-4cc0-afdf-ca8314270899</id><title>9/4 - Artist Collectives: Make Your Mark on the Art Market This Fall at Superfine!
